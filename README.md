# Sensors

Includes sensor readings (IMU, GPS, Compass, Ultrasonic)

This code is used to confirm the data from the sensors

## Motors Code
This code is for testing the code of the motors

## Sensors_readings Code
This code is for testing the incoming data of the sensors IMU, GPS, and Compass

## Ultrasonic Code
This code is for testing the code of ultrasonic sensors

## Testing Code
This code is for testing the code of commands sent from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino using ROS

## Libraries
- Adafruit_HMC5883_Unified
- Adafruit_Unified_Sensor
- NewPing
- TinyGPSPlus
- ros_lib "but it's too heavy to upload so you need to upload it from Arduino site"
